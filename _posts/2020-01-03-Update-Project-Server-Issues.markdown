**Server Set Up Fixed:**

I had a few problems with getting the server to run and make API calls to retrieve messages. I arranged a meeting with Mike from FarmLink who had developed the boilerplate for the server and we fixed several bugs with the server and pushed changes to the github repository. With the help of Mike, I also understood now how the server is being implemented and what each API call does

The server is now fully working without any bugs and calls to API requests can be made to get JSON objects.
