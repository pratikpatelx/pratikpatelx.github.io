## Milestone 1 Implementation
Completed milestone 1 features (Initial Planning)  
Created the Flask API for pulling data from the database and the overall project setup with the create react app.

Note: Sender Filter is the one that is implemented
User is able to now manage messages from the Sender.
Implemented a table to Display the queue of messages in a standardized format that is the time and date, who set the messages? and what was the message?. implemented a list that displays who sent the message

However, I was unable to Complete the search feature and also the JSON API for messages is really large in terms of data which is making my website slow, I am working on a solution to this.

GrainType, ReadBy, Parsed/Unparsed filters are left to be implemented.
