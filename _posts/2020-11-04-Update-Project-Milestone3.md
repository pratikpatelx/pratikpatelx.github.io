## Milestone 3 Implementation
Complete Grain type filter added dropdown search menu so that user can search quickly for the appropriate grain type eg Canola, Wheat etc. Data is displayed neatly in a table with all definitions from the table based on grain type selected from the dropdown menu. Added Few Methods in the API.py and database.py file to search and retrieve data from the database.
Pushed changes to the GitHub repository.
Users can now ADD sender, We are not suppose to implement the delete and insertion methods as the project manager said we should not be throwing away data for any reason so I didn't do that.

Read By, Parsed, Unparsed is Left to be implemented
