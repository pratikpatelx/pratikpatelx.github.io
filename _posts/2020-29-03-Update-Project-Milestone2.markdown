## Milestone 2 Implementation
Did not Complete milestone 2 features. The last 2-3 weeks I have been working on other courses Assignments and Labs due to the current situation (COVID-19) I was unable to get enough time to work on this project milestone 2.

What is left to be implemented:
I will start working on Milestone 2 features that is:
* Manage decision messages from users (View/Delete/Comment)
* The Quick Lookup feature.
* Managing Deleting, Adding Cash Prices 	 

What is currently implemented:  

* user is able to Add state to the items and maintain state using a database.

* Website can Display Error Messages For Data that couldnâ€™t be parsed,
* Display All Decision Messages from Users

I am constantly communicating with Michael (Project Supervisor) from FarmLink on the project requirements.
